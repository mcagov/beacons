        Thank you for registering your 406 MHz beacon, this is to confirm that
        it has been recorded on the UK Beacon database and a copy of the record
        is attached for you to check.

        It is a legal requirement to register UK 406 MHz beacons and depending
        on the size or your vessel or aircraft, you may be required to prove
        registration, as such we are enclosing two adhesive labels as proof of
        registration. Please make sure that one of the labels is attached to
        your beacon and the other is placed in a prominent position e.g. with
        the vessels' documentation. Please avoid placing a label on the battery
        cover if there is one because batteries are often replaced during
        servicing. Should you require further labels, please contact the
        Registry.
      </p>
      <p>
        The use of PLBs overland in the UK became legal in 2012. If you own a
        PLB, and wish to use it overland, or if you intend to use your PLB on a
        variety of vessels, please sign-in to your online account and add
        additional uses.
