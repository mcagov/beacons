# Beacons Registration Webapp

The frontend application for the Beacons Registration service enables:

- [406Mhz beacon](https://www.gov.uk/maritime-safety-weather-and-navigation/register-406-mhz-beacons) owners to register their details with the Maritime & Coastguard Agency
- Search and rescue [Mission Control Centres](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_control_centre_(Cospas-Sarsat)>) to retrieve information about beacons during distress signal activations

This directory contains the frontend application of the service. It is built using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and
based on the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).

This application depends on the [Beacons Registration API](https://github.com/mcagov/beacons-service).

## Getting started

### Dependencies

To develop locally, you'll need:

- [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

#### Environment variables

Included in the repo is a `.env.example` file containing non-secret environment variables. This file should be copied
to `.env.local` on first pull and augmented with the secrets contained in 1Password.

### Running the application

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Running in Docker

To run the application in a production-like environment:

```bash
docker-compose up --force-recreate
```

## Testing

Our approach to testing:

- **Testing the rendering of React components**. We use [React testing library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) with Jest to ensure the rendered pages are what the user expects to see.
- **Testing logic**. We segregate frontend logic from components by defining reusable TypeScript functions in `src/lib/`. Unit tests for these functions using Jest are in `test/lib`.
- **UI testing**. We use [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress.html) to ensure the logic of the frontend matches the requirements.
- **End-to-end testing**. We also use [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress.html) to test the user journey from end to end.

### Running unit tests

- `npm run test` -- Runs all unit tests in the `test/` directory
- `npm run test:watch` -- Runs unit tests in watch mode

### Running UI tests

- `docker compose up` -- Start the app in production mode.
- `npm run cypress:open` -- Run Cypress tests in the `cypress/integration` directory with the [Cypress Test Runner](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/test-runner.html#Overview)
- `npm run cypress:watch` -- Run Cypress tests with the Test Runner, with Cypress watching test files for changes
- `npm run cypress:run` -- Run Cypress tests in the `cypress/integration` directory in the [command line](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line.html#cypress-run)
- `npm run cypress:run:firefox` -- Run Cypress tests in the `cypress/integration` directory using Firefox (requires Firefox to be installed)

The UI tests are a part of our CI/CD pipeline.

- The tests run in Chrome
- [Web Security is disabled](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/web-security#Disabling-Web-Security) in our [cypress config](cypress.json)
  - This is to work around the [same superdomain](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/web-security#Same-superdomain-per-test) limitation
  - e.g. [tests that access localhost as well as B2C](cypress/integration/single-beacon-owner/i-can-create-and-use-an-account.spec.ts)

#### Running end-to-end tests:

- Bring up the: Service, Database and Webapp
- Cypress needs the `SESSION_TOKEN` environment variable to be set
  - This value is set in env.local
  - The value is in 1Password - the token has been set to expire in 2031
- `npm run cypress:open` or `npm run cypress:watch` -- Run Cypress tests in the `cypress/endToEnd` directory with the Test Runner
- `npm run cypress:e2e` -- Run Cypress tests in the `cypress/endToEnd` directory in the command line

The end-to-end tests are also a part of our CI/CD pipeline

- They require the env vars `SESSION_TOKEN`, `JWT_SECRET` and `WEBAPP_CLIENT_SECRET`
  - These have been set as Github secrets in the repository
- Currently, the values are the same as the ones used locally (`.env.local`)
  - They're listed in 1Password in case the local or repository values change
