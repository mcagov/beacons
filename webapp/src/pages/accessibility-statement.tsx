              The features listed below have restricted usability for the
              following reasons. Error suggestions on the &apos;Create a Beacon
              Registry Account - GOV.UK&apos; page are not specific of the error
              that has occurred. This fails 3.3.3 Error Suggestion (Level AA).
              However, this page belongs to a third party which is beyond the

              Some users found some link text difficult to read due to the low
              contrast of foreground and background colours (foreground:
              #1d70b8; background: #FFFFFF; point size: 12pt; weight: normal).
              The expected minimum colour contrast ratio for text of this size
              and weight is 7:1. This fails 1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced) (Level
              AAA)
