            <h3>Why can I see these beacons?</h3>
            <p>
              The new Maritime and Coastguard Beacon Registry Service was
              brought online in 2021. We have made every effort to move your
              beacon records (registered through the old service) to your new
              new customer account. We do this by matching the email address on
              your old records to the email address used to create your new
              customer account.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Why am I being asked to review and confirm if these beacons are
              mine?
            </h3>
            <p>
              To ensure we have correctly matched a beacon to you, we ask all
              customers to review and confirm the beacons are theirs.
              <br />
              <br />
              Due to Data Protection rules and regulation, we are unable to
              display any personally identifiable information, so please ensure
              to check the HEX ID/UIN or other information shown is yours.
              <br />
              <br />
              Once you confirm the beacon is yours, you will be asked to provide
              additional personal and beacon use information, vital to Search
              and Rescue.
              <br />
              <br />
              Only when a beacon record has been confirmed as yours, will you
              then be able to view, edit and delete your beacon information from
              your online customer account.
            </p>
            <h3>Why can I see beacons that are not mine?</h3>
            <p>
              To ensure we have correctly matched a beacon to you, we ask all
              customers to review and confirm the beacons are theirs.
              <br />
              <br />
              We may have matched a beacon to you because it was previously
              registered to the same email address. You can delete any beacons
              from your account that are not yours. By doing this you will no
              longer see it when you log in, but Search and rescue will still
              have a record of it in an emergency.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Is any of the information I previously provided about my beacon(s)
              lost?
            </h3>
            <p>
              We have copied across all previously registered beacons to the new
              service and this is available to Search and Rescue.
              <br />
              <br />
              Due to technical reasons, some of the information we copy across
              appears in a slightly different format when you view it in your
              Beacon Registry Account. However, no information is lost. Please
              check and update any of your records to ensure your information is
              up to date.
            </p>
            <h3>
              I registered beacons using the old service, but I cannot see them
              here
            </h3>
            <p>
              You may have registered those beacons with a different email
              address. Please re-register any beacons using the &quot;Register a
              new beacon&quot; button below. This is the safest way to ensure we
              have the correct information, in case the beacon is activated
            </p>
            <h3>
              Do I need to review and confirm my beacons now? Or can I do this
              at a later date?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Your beacon information will always be visible to Search and
              Rescue, even if you choose not to review and confirm if the beacon
              information belongs to you.
              <br />
              <br />
              You can choose to review and confirm beacon information at any
              time.
              <br />
              <br />
              But we recommend that all customers review and confirm their
              beacon record(s) because it provides Search and Rescue with the
              most up to date information in an emergency. It also enables
              customers to manage beacon information online themselves.
            </p>
            <h3>
              What is the benefit of registering and managing my beacon(s)
              online?
            </h3>
            <p>
              The new online Beacons Registry Service gives customers greater
              control over their beacon information.
              <br />
              <br />
              Customers can now register as many beacons as they like, make
              changes to their beacon records and delete a beacon from their
              account instantly, without delays.
